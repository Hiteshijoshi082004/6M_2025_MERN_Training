        <p> HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and  web applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.
            Hyper Text: HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.
            Markup language: A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.
            Web Page: A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.
            Hence, HTML is a markup language which is used for creating attractive web pages with the help of styling, and which looks in a nice format on a web browser. An HTML document is made of many HTML tags and each HTML tag contains different content.
            In the late 1980's , a physicist, Tim Berners-Lee who was a contractor at CERN, proposed a system for CERN researchers. In 1989, he wrote a memo proposing an internet based hypertext system.
            Tim Berners-Lee is known as the father of HTML. The first available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags" proposed by Tim in late 1991. The latest version of HTML is HTML5, which we will learn later in this tutorial.
            Since the time HTML was invented there are lots of HTML versions in market, the brief introduction about the HTML version is given below:
            HTML 1.0: The first version of HTML was 1.0, which was the barebones version of HTML language, and it was released in1991.
            HTML 2.0: This was the next version which was released in 1995, and it was standard language version for website design. HTML 2.0 was able to support extra features such as form-based file upload, form elements such as text box, option button, etc.
            HTML 3.2: HTML 3.2 version was published by W3C in early 1997. This version was capable of creating tables and providing support for extra options for form elements. It can also support a web page with complex mathematical equations. It became an official standard for any browser till January 1997. Today it is practically supported by most of the browsers.
            HTML 4.01: HTML 4.01 version was released on December 1999, and it is a very stable version of HTML language. This version is the current official standard, and it provides added support for stylesheets (CSS) and scripting ability for various multimedia elements.
            HTML5 : HTML5 is the newest version of HyperText Markup language. The first draft of this version was announced in January 2008. There are two major organizations one is W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), and another one is WHATWG( Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) which are involved in the development of HTML 5 version, and still, it is under development.

            CSS stands for Cascading style sheets. It describes to the user how to display HTML elements on the screen in a proper format. CSS is the language that is used to style HTML documents. In simple words, cascading style sheets are a language used to simplify the process of making a webpage.
            CSS is used to handle some parts of the webpage. With the help of CSS, we can control the colour of text and style of fonts, and we can control the spacing between the paragraph and many more things. CSS is easy to understand but provides strong control on the Html documents.CSS is combined with HTML.
            Advantages of CSS
            Here are the following advantages of CSS, such as:
            Faster page speed: It has a faster page speed than other code's page speeds. With the help of the CSS rule, we can apply it to all occurrences of certain tags in HTML documents.
            Better user experience: CSS makes a webpage very attractive to the eyes. Also, CSS makes it user-friendly. When the button or text is in a proper format, it improves the user experience.
            Quicker Development time: With the help of CSS, we can specify the format and style the multiple pages into one code string. In cascading style sheet, we can make a duplicate copy of several website pages.
            If we make a webpage, it has the same formatting, looks, and feel, so with the help of the CSS rule for one page, and it is sufficient for all the pages.
            Easy Formatting changes: In CSS, if we need to make changes in the format, it is very easy; we only need to change the one-page format it will automatically apply to the other pages of CSS.
            There is no need to correct individual pages in a CSS style sheet. If we fix a CSS style sheet, it will automatically update the other CSS style sheet.
            Compatibility: Compatibility is very important in today's age. If we create any webpage, it should be very responsive and user-friendly. CSS is used with Html to make webpage design responsive.
            Why do We Use CSS?
            As we all know, CSS is a powerful style sheet language used to control the HTML document to improve the webpage design.
            CSS provides efficiency in webpage design: It also provides updates so our webpage works appropriately. With the help of CSS, we can create and apply those rules within the website. If we create a webpage design separately, we can make changes in our style sheet, and it will affect all the style sheets.
            CSS provides faster page download: CSS helps with faster page download because when we download a page, we get the cache that helps to load a page, but with the help of CSS, we can lead to load a lighter page which helps to improve the performance.
            CSS is easy to work: In CSS, we can visual aspect of the website separate entirely from the content; using CSS, we can create a website that allows us to make quick layou0074.

            JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language. The name was suggested and provided in the times when Java was gaining popularity in the market. In addition to web browsers, databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language.
            Features of JavaScript
            There are following features of JavaScript:
            All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.
            JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming language.
            JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the operation).
            JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.
            It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.
            It is a case-sensitive language.
            JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.
            It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.
            History of JavaScript
            In 1993, Mosaic, the first popular web browser, came into existence. In the year 1994, Netscape was founded by Marc Andreessen. He realized that the web needed to become more dynamic. Thus, a 'glue language' was believed to be provided to HTML to make web designing easy for designers and part-time programmers. Consequently, in 1995, the company recruited Brendan Eich intending to implement and embed Scheme programming language to the browser. But, before Brendan could start, the company merged with Sun Microsystems for adding Java into its Navigator so that it could compete with Microsoft over the web technologies and platforms. Now, two languages were there: Java and the scripting language. Further, Netscape decided to give a similar name to the scripting language as Java's. It led to 'Javascript'. Finally, in May 1995, Marc Andreessen coined the first code of Javascript named 'Mocha'. Later, the marketing team replaced the name with 'LiveScript'. But, due to trademark reasons and certain other reasons, in December 1995, the language was finally renamed to 'JavaScript'. From then, JavaScript came into existence.
            Application of JavaScript
            JavaScript is used to create interactive websites. It is mainly used for:
            Client-side validation,
            Dynamic drop-down menus,
            Displaying date and time,
            Displaying pop-up windows and dialog boxes (like an alert dialog box, confirm dialog box and prompt dialog box),
            Displaying clocks etc.
